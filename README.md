DevOps Project: End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline
Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of multiple DevOps tools and practices to streamline the deployment and management of a Java-based application. It incorporates containerization, orchestration, infrastructure as code (IaC), monitoring, and automated quality checks.


Features
Infrastructure Management: Automated provisioning and configuration of AWS resources using Terraform and Ansible.
CI/CD Pipeline: Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery, integrated with Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm for deployment.
Containerization: Docker for creating lightweight and portable application images.
Orchestration: Kubernetes for managing containerized applications in clusters.
Code Quality and Security: SonarQube for code quality checks and JFrog Artifactory for artifact storage.
Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and alerting.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Java (Spring Boot application)
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Kubernetes (with Helm for deployment templating)
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
Configuration Management: Ansible
CI/CD: Jenkins
Code Quality: SonarQube
Artifact Management: JFrog Artifactory
Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana
Cloud Provider: AWS
Workflow
Infrastructure Provisioning:

Use Terraform to provision AWS resources (EC2, RDS, S3, etc.).
Use Ansible for configuring servers and deploying dependencies.
Build and Test:

Code is pushed to a version control system (e.g., GitHub/GitLab).
Jenkins fetches the code, builds the Java application, and runs unit tests.
SonarQube performs static code analysis.
Artifact Management:

Built artifacts are pushed to JFrog Artifactory.
Containerization:

Docker images are created and tagged.
Images are pushed to a Docker registry.
Deployment:

Helm charts manage Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application to Kubernetes clusters.
Kubernetes ensures high availability and scalability.
Monitoring:

Prometheus monitors the application and cluster metrics.
Grafana visualizes the metrics for proactive issue resolution.
Prerequisites
AWS account with necessary permissions.
Terraform installed locally.
Ansible installed locally.
Docker and Kubernetes installed and configured.
Jenkins server with required plugins (e.g., Docker, SonarQube, Kubernetes).
SonarQube and JFrog Artifactory instances.
